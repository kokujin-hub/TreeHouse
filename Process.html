        <h1 style="font-size: 35px;">Here is my process in building a Treehouse</h1>
        <p class="process">
           <br> We will start by determining which trees are suitable for holding a treehouse, and then look at some sample plans to get an idea of what is possible and indicative 
            costs.  Next we will work out the size, layout and style of the treehouse and come up with some draft plans. After deciding on the plan to proceed with, we contract an 
            engineer to go through the design and ensure that it will be safe and stable, now and as the tree grows. Once the plans are finalised, I will organise any necessary 
            building consent and construction can begin.</br> 
            
            <br>The building process starts with the platform, and after this has been constructed rigorous testing will take place to ensure
            that it meets the highest standards. Next we will add the wall framing and  install the roof before building the floors, walls, entrances, windows and railings. If your 
            treehouse has a particular theme, this is where we will add the little touches that bring that to life, such as doorknobs, lighting and decorative elements. Lastly comes 
            the really fun part as we add those special extras such as slides, bridges, fire poles, zip lines and climbing nets to make your treehouse really stand out!</br>

            <br>
            Once the main construction is complete and all the fun features are installed, we will focus on the finishing touches to personalize your treehouse. This includes 
            painting or staining, adding comfortable seating, custom decorations, an+d safety features such as railings and locks. We’ll also review safety guidelines with you to 
            ensure the treehouse remains a secure and enjoyable space for years to come. After completion, I recommend periodic inspections and maintenance to address any wear and 
            tear, especially as the tree grows and environmental conditions change. Regular upkeep will help preserve the integrity of the structure and ensure it continues to be a 
            magical and safe retreat for your family and friends.</br>

            <br>Throughout the entire process, I am committed to providing clear communication and expert guidance to make the experience enjoyable and stress-free for you. From 
            initial planning to final inspections, I will keep you informed of progress and involve you in key decisions. My goal is to create a beautiful, safe, and unique treehouse 
            that perfectly matches your vision while respecting the natural beauty of your trees. Once completed, I’ll also offer advice on how to care for your treehouse and ensure 
            it remains a treasured part of your outdoor space for many years to come.</br>
